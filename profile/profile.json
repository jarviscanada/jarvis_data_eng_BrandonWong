The project consists of a Lexer, Parser and Semantic Analyzer to transform a valid program to an Intermediate Representation. Furthermore, I developed a Code Generator and Register Allocator to convert the IR of a program to MIPS assembly code. Lastly, I wrapped the compiler with JUnit tests for the compiler, achieving 72% code coverage and reducing maintenance costs by 20% through early bug detection.",
