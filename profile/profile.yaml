# Personal introduction
summary: "I am an aspiring software engineer who enjoys piecing blocks together: be it ideas from disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have a strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering, full-stack development and web design.

My passion lies in solving business problems to communicate complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. In Ensemble Technologies Inc., I collaborated with a team of six to transform a client’s mobile car inspection application to reduce the client service time by 20%.

In my undergraduate studies, I've taken on various leadership roles leading teams of 3+ developers to build 5+ full-stack applications that satisfies a clients' needs. I was able to adjust to different team dynamics, translate from requirements to manageable tasks and meet to tight timeframes.
 
I graduated in April 2024 at McGill University in Software Engineering and I'm interested in full-time software developer roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at brandon-wh-wong@outlook.com."
